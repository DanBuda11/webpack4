# Webpack 4 + Babel 7 + React 16 Framework

## To Do

- Do I need to do anything with publicPath?
- Do I need to add something to my JS for Hot Module Replacement such as:

```javascript
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept();
}
```

- And can I add the above to index.js or does it need to be added to all js files?
- Make a note that ESLint, Stylelint will be added
- Comment everything in the code as documentation and to remind myself what stuff does, as well as show others
- Redo README when done for good documentation
